2017-03-14 Hello World! First Commit to Git, as I see fit.
Working nine to five while I chew on the bit
Now I'm tired of working on mainframes, 
Black and green terminals and eyestrain, 
It's a drain, it's lame, and it's always the same 
But that's how it is when you're stuck in the game

Now I'm starting up my own projects, 
Even if it's some pull request rejects
At least I'll have tried so I can abide
that I've plied what's inside and I won't have to hide

From my peers and myself 
For the sake of my health
Relax my poor brain; this dead language migraine 
And abstain from the inane while I feign it's my aim

To see how it goes and and what I can express
My mind is on fire and this work is a mess
If I can stay calm and focus my energy
Then I can leave behind those people that like to say 'synergy'
